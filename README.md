A simple, clean, and neat timer application built with Angular.

## Features

- 🟢 Start: Initiates the timer.
- 🟡 Lap: Records the current time since the timer started.
- 🔴 Stop: Halts the timer.

## Tech Stack

- **Angular**: Used as the primary framework for building the application.
- **BEM**: A CSS methodology to keep the styling structured and organized. This was my first attempt at integrating BEM, and while I'm still learning, I believe it has brought some organization to the project's CSS.
